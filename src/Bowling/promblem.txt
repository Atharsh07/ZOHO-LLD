Bowling

Design a Bowling Game System

Rules of the Game

• The game can be played by multiple players.
• Primary goal is to knock off all the pins to gain scores. The game consists of ten frames. In
each frame the bowler (player) has two chances to knock off the pins.
• If the bowler is able to knock down all the pins in one strike, it is called a strike. If the bowler
does it with two it is called a spare.
• If there is a spare, the player gets 5 bonus points. For strike, the player gets 10 bonus points.
• In the final set, a player who rolls a spare or a strike is allowed to roll the extra balls to
complete the set. However, only a maximum of three balls can be rolled in the final set.

Rules of the System

• During the game, players and their scores will be maintained and shown by the system and
winner will be declared at the end of the game.
• Likewise, multiple games can be played in parallel on multiple free lanes.
