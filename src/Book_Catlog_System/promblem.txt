Book Catalog System

All books should have attributes: Name, Author, Publisher, Publish Year, Category, Price, Count
(sold)

The following should be implemented on top of this catalog:

 Add book to the catalog
 Search a book by partial book/author name
 Get most sold books, by author name/category, limit

Maintain the system on memory (no files/DB)
