Design a call taxi booking application with the following constraints:

    There are 6 points (A, B, C, D, E, F) arranged linearly, and the distance between consecutive points is 15 km.
    The travel time between two consecutive points is 1 hour.
    All taxis start from point A.
    Minimum fare: Rs. 100 for the first 5 km. For every additional kilometer, Rs. 10 is charged.
    Allocate a free taxi that is closest to the customer. If two taxis are at the same distance, the one with lower earnings should be allotted.
    If no taxis are available, reject the booking.
    Display the earnings and booking details of each taxi after every booking.
